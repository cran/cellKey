Description: Data from statistical agencies and other institutions often
    need to be protected before they can be published. This package 
    can be used to perturb statistical tables in a consistent way. The
    main idea is to add - at the micro data level - a record key for each
    unit. Based on these keys, for any cell in a statistical table a
    cell key is computed as a function on the record keys contributing to
    a specific cell. Values that are added to the cell in order to perturb
    it are derived from a lookup-table that maps values of cell keys to 
    specific perturbation values. The theoretical basis for the methods 
    implemented can be found in Thompson, Broadfoot and Elazar 
    (2013) <https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2013/Topic_1_ABS.pdf>
    which was extended and enhanced by Giessing and Tent 
    (2019) <https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2019/mtg1/SDC2019_S2_Germany_Giessing_Tent_AD.pdf>.
